I currently plan to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, having completed a technical degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I spend my days mastering React and JavaScript, and exploring the intersection of development and security. I believe that great code isn't just functional‚Äîit's secure, accessible, and meaningful.
